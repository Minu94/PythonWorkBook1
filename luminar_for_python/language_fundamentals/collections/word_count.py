line="hello hai how are you"
words=line.split(" ") #split by space to get word seperatele
dict={}
for word in words:
    if(word not in dict):
        dict{word}=1 #word:1 # supposed to make the form {"hello":1,"hai":2
    else:
        dict[word]+=1
#create list [1,2,3,4,5,6]
find square of each element then from result even even listodd odd list
[10,20,30,40,50]=50 count of 50
[2,4,8]=ouput to be [12,10,6]
[3,2,5]=ouput [7,8,5]
